This project's goal is to help drive innovation in the container orchestration space. If you would like to be apart of that, Please feel free to help out!

We follow standard Rust guide-lines for code. Before pushing any code,  `cargo fmt` and `cargo check` and `cargo test` should all be run and pass. CI will also run on your PR and check all of these things. Dont worry if one fails, it happens to all of us. Just correct the issue and update the PR!

When submitting a PR. please keep it to a single commit with a change to a single bit of functionality.

During the week of June 24th - June 28th a daily standup will take place to organize efforts probably at 9am EST, unless someone from the west coast people want to join. After if there is interest monthly meetings will take place.

There are a lot of little things that need done, documentation, bugs and the likes. But there are also a lot of Features that need done. If you want to take on a feature, please read the (architecture)[architecture.md] document to ensure a good understanding of not only the goals, but also how they should be designed.
